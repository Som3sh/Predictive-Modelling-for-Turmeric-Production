### Abstract

#### Aim of the Project
The primary objective of this research project is to conduct a comparative analysis of turmeric production in the Indian states of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. By leveraging historical production data and employing the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, the study aims to forecast turmeric production for the upcoming years. The project seeks to determine whether Odisha's turmeric production will catch up with or fall behind that of Andhra Pradesh in terms of both area cultivated and total production.

#### Methodology
The methodology encompasses several key steps:

1. **Data Acquisition**: Historical data on turmeric production, including area and production figures from 2018-2019 to 2022-2023, will be sourced from the provided state-wise production reports[1][2][3].

2. **Data Preprocessing**: The collected data will be cleaned and formatted to ensure it is suitable for time series analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial data exploration will be conducted to identify trends, seasonality, and other relevant patterns.

4. **Stationarity Testing**: Tests such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test will be applied to check the stationarity of the time series data.

5. **ARIMA Modeling**: The optimal parameters for the ARIMA model (p, d, q) will be determined, and the model will be fitted to the historical production data.

6. **Forecasting**: The ARIMA model will be used to forecast turmeric production for the subsequent years.

7. **Comparative Analysis**: The forecasts for Odisha and Andhra Pradesh will be compared to assess the production trends.

8. **Evaluation**: The model's performance will be evaluated using statistical metrics such as MAE and RMSE.

#### Keywords
- Turmeric Production
- Odisha
